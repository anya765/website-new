<p>I think creating a game is the ultimate art form. I used to play a ton of chess growing up so I had a particular fascination with solving games (checkers, the clearly inferior game had been solved since computers could play gams). I think it’s beautiful to think of a game created as early as chess was - with a unique combination of pieces that all move differently yet maintain a symmetric nature. With one side starting before the other, it’s rare in a turn based game to have a game that can’t allow someone to win fully purely on the basis of the intense computation we have available today.</p>
<p>Alpha Zero and Alpha Go are exciting feats</p>
<p>Logic games are fun for me.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I listened to Alan Lee’s podcast with Tim Ferris on building great games. {exploding kittens}</p>
<p>The first time I played Spot it! it felt like love at first sight. The defined number of interesting objects (zebras, dinosours, yin yang symbols, bombs) within 55 cards shuffled together, everything mapped out so perfectly that you could pick up any 2 cards and exactly one object would be in common between them —that’s the kind of eloquence worth living for. The first time I deciphered how this game worked was incredible, it seems so simple - in fact, I’d try explaining it but this video does a wonderful job of explaining it: <a href="https://youtu.be/VTDKqW_GLkw?si=HXO9gqojrCXjjCwO">https://youtu.be/VTDKqW_GLkw?si=HXO9gqojrCXjjCwO</a></p>
<p>Then, it’s the arch rival Ghost version of Spot it, which is the game embodied equivalent of running out of versions to play of “the country game” and claiming that the next person must state a country that ends with the same letter your country started with. In less words, way more interesting. It involves 5 physical pieces and a deck of cards.</p>
<p>duolingo’s founder {gameifying duolingo} Actually - it’s interesting because he talks pretty actively about how he has entire teams built around optimizing a specific metric (user streaks, time on app, etc.</p>
<p>This love letter’s probably getting a bit too long but I wanted to share a game I spent a few days thinking about and have now probably played this with at least 20 people. It’s a version of tic tac toe.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve explained the game, I feel like it’s fitting to write a critique: have categorized archetypes into a few distinct categories. It’s also worth noting, not for any particular reason — but i’ve never lost, but I can’t pinpoint a formula for winning.</p>
<p>(If anyone would like to challenge me - my email is always open)</p>
<p>I’ve made and played many games in the past, but this is by far the most eloquent, simple, and exciting one.</p>
<p>I find it hard to describe games. You can get good at them. Really good (as anyone who has ever played one of these games with me would know). But it’s hard to encapsulate the feeling of things just clicking together and working out.</p>
