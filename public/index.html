    <p>
        I spend most of my time these days working on interesting engineering problems, particularly in controls and systems. I enjoy the elegance of control theory and how it allows us to understand and manipulate complex dynamic systems. The rest of the time, I like playing games like Go -- and chess  (and like solving the occasional <a href="https://projecteuler.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">puzzle</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
        I appreciate thoughtful disagreements and like having my mind change about something. I've often found these moments to be most critical.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I'm focused on developing a strong mental framework for creating hypotheses about different industries, especially in the realm of control systems and automation. And occasionally writing about my thoughts on here.

    <h3>Previously I:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Was an early employee at a cool drone company, and learned how to fly FPV drones. I work a few hours a week as a drone show engineer :D</li>
        <li>Led software and wearables for a now acquired high performance athletics company</li>
        <li>Did research and engineering with Purdue & Ethereum Foundation on ZK Proofs</li>
        <li>Moved out @ 17 + played tennis in SoCal for 6 months after graduating high school</li>
        <li>Played an abnormal amount of chess growing up (and represented Canada at intl. tournaments + SPFGI 3x)</li>
        <li>Analyzed satellite telemetry data @ JPL</li>
        <li>Built Lithium Titanate (last forever) batteries</li>
        <li>Wrote a paper on how the market for lemons perpetuates poverty traps with Solar4Africa</li>
        <li>Did other things & (kinda) failed â€“ like creating an AI card game similar to Cards Against Humanity, trying to run my own online electronics shop -- and going to school...</li>
