    <p>
        I spend most of my time these days working on interesting engineering problems.The rest of the times, I like playing games like Go -- and chess.
    <p> I appreciate thoughtful disagreements and like having my mind change about something. I've often found these moments to be most critical.</p>
    <p> Currently, I’m focused on developing a strong mental framework for creating hypotheses about different industries. And occasionally writing about my thoughts on here.</p>
    <h3>Previously I:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Was an early employee at a cool drone company, and learned how to fly FPV drones. Now I'm a part time "drone show engineer." </li>
        <li>Led software and wearables for a now acquired high performance athletics company</li>
        <li>Did research and engineering with Purdue & Ethereum Foundation on ZK Proofs</li>
        <li>Moved out @ 17 + played tennis in SoCal for 6 months after graduating high school</li>
        <li>Played an abnormal amount of chess growing up (and represented Canada at intl. tournaments + SPFGI 3x)</li>
        <li>Analyzed satellite telemetry data @ JPL</li>
        <li>Built Lithium Titanate (last forever) batteries </li>
        <li>Wrote a paper on how the market for lemons perpetuates poverty traps with Solar4Africa</li>
        <li>Did other things & (kinda) failed – like creating an AI card game similar to Cards Against Humanity, trying to run my own online electronics shop -- and going to school...</li>
    </ul>
